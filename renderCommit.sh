## Author: Thomas Girke
## Last update: Feb 4, 2021

## (1) Makes sure you are in correct branch (currently there is only one)
git checkout main  

## (2) Build site and copy rendered pages to docs 
# rm -rf public/* # clean out public -> not required with publishDir = "docs" in config.toml
# rm -rf docs/* # clean out docs (assumes dir exists) -> not required with publishDir = "docs" in config.toml
# Rscript -e "blogdown::build_site()" # Build site with blogdown via command-line call
Rscript -e "blogdown::build_site(build_rmd = 'md5sum')" # runs build only for rmd pages that have changed
# cp -r public/* docs/ # Copy build/rendered pages to docs -> not required with publishDir = "docs" in config.toml

## (3) Commit and push changes
git add -A :/
git commit -am "some edits"
git push -u origin main
echo "Committed/pushed changes to GitHub"
