### Introduction

[_`systemPipeR`_](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/systemPipeR.html)
is provides flexible utilities for building and running automated end-to-end
analysis workflows for a wide range of research applications, including
next-generation sequencing (NGS) experiments, such as RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq,
VAR-Seq and Ribo-Seq [@H_Backman2016-bt]. Important features include a uniform
workflow interface across different data analysis applications, automated
report generation, and support for running both R and command-line software,
such as NGS aligners or peak/variant callers, on local computers or compute
clusters (Figure 1). The latter supports interactive job submissions and batch
submissions to queuing systems of clusters. For instance, `systemPipeR` can
be used with any command-line aligners such as `BWA` [@Li2013-oy; @Li2009-oc],
`HISAT2` [@Kim2015-ve], `TopHat2` [@Kim2013-vg] and `Bowtie2`
[@Langmead2012-bs], as well as the R-based NGS aligners
[_`Rsubread`_](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/Rsubread.html)
[@Liao2013-bn] and [_`gsnap
(gmapR)`_](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/gmapR.html)
[@Wu2010-iq]. Efficient handling of complex sample sets (_e.g._ FASTQ/BAM
files) and experimental designs are facilitated by a well-defined sample
annotation infrastructure which improves reproducibility and user-friendliness
of many typical analysis workflows in the NGS area [@Lawrence2013-kt]. 

The main motivation and advantages of using _`systemPipeR`_ for complex data analysis tasks are:

1. Facilitates the design of complex data analysis workflows 
2. Consistent workflow interface for different large-scale data types
3. Makes NGS analysis with Bioconductor utilities more accessible to new users
4. Simplifies usage of command-line software from within R
5. Reduces the complexity of using compute clusters for R and command-line software
6. Accelerates runtime of workflows via parallelization on computer systems with multiple CPU cores and/or multiple compute nodes
6. Improves reproducibility by automating analyses and generation of analysis reports

**Figure 1:** Relevant features in _`systemPipeR`_.
Workflow design concepts are illustrated under (A & B). Examples of
*systemPipeRâ€™s* visualization functionalities are given under (C). </br>

A central concept for designing workflows within the _`systemPipeR`_
environment is the use of workflow management containers. They support
the widely used community standard [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org/) 
(CWL) for describing analysis workflows in a generic and reproducible manner, introducing
_`SYSargs2`_ workflow control class (see Figure 2). Using this community
standard in _`systemPipeR`_ has many advantages. For instance, the integration
of CWL allows running _`systemPipeR`_ workflows from a single specification
instance either entirely from within R, from various command-line wrappers
(e.g., *cwl-runner*) or from other languages (*, e.g.,* Bash or Python).
_`systemPipeR`_ includes support for both command-line and R/Bioconductor
software as well as resources for containerization, parallel evaluations on
computer clusters along with the automated generation of interactive analysis
reports.

An important feature of _`systemPipeR's`_ CWL interface is that it provides two
options to run command-line tools and workflows based on CWL. First, one can
run CWL in its native way via an R-based wrapper utility for *cwl-runner* or
*cwl-tools* (CWL-based approach). Second, one can run workflows using CWL's
command-line and workflow instructions from within R (R-based approach). In the
latter case the same CWL workflow definition files (*e.g.* `*.cwl` and `*.yml`)
are used but rendered and executed entirely with R functions defined by
_`systemPipeR`_, and thus use CWL mainly as a command-line and workflow
definition format rather than execution software to run workflows. In this regard
_`systemPipeR`_ also provides several convenience functions that are useful for
designing and debugging workflows, such as a command-line rendering function to
retrieve the exact command-line strings for each data set and processing step
prior to running a command-line.

This overview introduces the design of a new CWL S4 class in _`systemPipeR`_, 
as well as the custom command-line interface, combined with the overview of all
the common analysis steps of NGS experiments.

### Workflow design structure using _`SYSargs2`_ 

The flexibility of _`systemPipeR's`_ workflow control class scales to any 
number of analysis steps necessary in a workflow. This can include 
variable combinations of steps requiring command-line or R-based software executions. 
The connectivity among all workflow steps is achieved by the _`SYSargs2`_ workflow
control class (see Figure 3).  This S4 class is a list-like container where
each instance stores all the input/output paths and parameter components
required for a particular data analysis step. _`SYSargs2`_ instances are
generated by two constructor functions, *loadWorkflow* and *renderWF*, using as
data input so called *targets* or *yaml* files as well as two *cwl* parameter files (for
details see below). When running preconfigured workflows, the only input the
user needs to provide is the initial *targets* file containing the paths to the
input files (*e.g.* FASTQ) along with unique sample labels. Subsequent targets
instances are created automatically. The parameters required for running
command-line software is provided by the parameter (*.cwl*) files described
below. 

To support one or many workflow steps in a single container the *`SYSargsList`* class 
capturing all information required to run, control and monitor complex workflows from 
start to finish. 

<center><img src="../SYS_WF.png"></center>

**Figure 2:** Workflow steps with input/output file operations are controlled by 
_`SYSargs2`_ objects. Each _`SYSargs2`_ instance is constructed from one *targets* 
and two *param* files. The only input provided by the user is the initial *targets* 
file. Subsequent *targets* instances are created automatically, from the previous 
output files. Any number of predefined or custom workflow steps are supported. One
or many _`SYSargs2`_ objects are organized in an *`SYSargsList`* container.

### Workflow Management with _`SYSargsList`_ 

In **systemPipeR** allows to create (multi-step analyses) and run workflows directly 
from R or the command-line using local systems, HPC cluster or cloud platforms.

## Getting Started

### Installation

The R software for running
[_`systemPipeR`_](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/systemPipeR.html)
can be downloaded from [_CRAN_](http://cran.at.r-project.org/). The
`systemPipeR` environment can be installed from the R console using the
[_`BiocManager::install`_](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BiocManager/index.html)
command. The associated data package
[_`systemPipeRdata`_](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/html/systemPipeRdata.html)
can be installed the same way. The latter is a helper package for generating
`systemPipeR` workflow environments with a single command containing all
parameter files and sample data required to quickly test and run workflows. 

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("systemPipeR")
BiocManager::install("systemPipeRdata")
```

Please note that if you desire to use a third-party command line tool, the
particular tool and dependencies need to be installed and executable. 
See [details](#tools). 

### Loading package and documentation

```{r documentation, eval=FALSE}
library("systemPipeR") # Loads the package
library(help="systemPipeR") # Lists package info
vignette("systemPipeR") # Opens vignette
```

### Load sample data and workflow templates

The mini sample FASTQ files used by this overview vignette as well as the
associated workflow reporting vignettes can be loaded via the
_`systemPipeRdata`_ package as shown below. The chosen data set
[`SRP010938`](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP010938) obtains 18
paired-end (PE) read sets from _Arabidposis thaliana_ [@Howard2013-fq].  To
minimize processing time during testing, each FASTQ file has been subsetted to
90,000-100,000 randomly sampled PE reads that map to the first 100,000
nucleotides of each chromosome of the _A. thalina_ genome. The corresponding
reference genome sequence (FASTA) and its GFF annotation files (provided in the
same download) have been truncated accordingly. This way the entire test sample
data set requires less than 200MB disk storage space. A PE read set has been
chosen for this test data set for flexibility, because it can be used for
testing both types of analysis routines requiring either SE (single-end) reads
or PE reads. 

The following generates a fully populated _`systemPipeR`_ workflow environment 
(here for RNA-Seq) in the current working directory of an R session. At this time 
the package includes workflow templates for RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, VAR-Seq, and Ribo-Seq. 
Templates for additional NGS applications will be provided in the future.

### Directory structure

The working environment of the sample data loaded in the previous step contains
the following pre-configured directory structure (Figure 4). Directory names are indicated
in  <span style="color:grey">***green***</span>. Users can change this
structure as needed, but need to adjust the code in their workflows
accordingly. 

* <span style="color:green">_**workflow/**_</span> (*e.g.* *rnaseq/*) 
    + This is the root directory of the R session running the workflow.
    + Run script ( *\*.Rmd*) and sample annotation (*targets.txt*) files are located here.
    + Note, this directory can have any name (*e.g.* <span style="color:green">_**rnaseq**_</span>, <span style="color:green">_**varseq**_</span>). Changing its name does not require any modifications in the run script(s).
  + **Important subdirectories**: 
    + <span style="color:green">_**param/**_</span> 
        + Stores non-CWL parameter files such as: *\*.param*, *\*.tmpl* and *\*.run.sh*. These files are only required for backwards compatibility to run old workflows using the previous custom command-line interface.
        + <span style="color:green">_**param/cwl/**_</span>: This subdirectory stores all the CWL parameter files. To organize workflows, each can have its own subdirectory, where all `CWL param` and `input.yml` files need to be in the same subdirectory. 
    + <span style="color:green">_**data/**_ </span>
        + FASTQ files
        + FASTA file of reference (*e.g.* reference genome)
        + Annotation files
        + etc.
    + <span style="color:green">_**results/**_</span>
        + Analysis results are usually written to this directory, including: alignment, variant and peak files (BAM, VCF, BED); tabular result files; and image/plot files
        + Note, the user has the option to organize results files for a given sample and analysis step in a separate subdirectory.

<center><img src="../SYSdir.png"></center>

**Figure 5:** *systemPipeR's* preconfigured directory structure.

The following parameter files are included in each workflow template:

1. *`targets.txt`*: initial one provided by user; downstream *`targets_*.txt`* files are generated automatically
2. *`*.param/cwl`*: defines parameter for input/output file operations, *e.g.*:
    + *`hisat2-se/hisat2-mapping-se.cwl`* 
    + *`hisat2-se/hisat2-mapping-se.yml`*
3. *`*_run.sh`*: optional bash scripts 
4. Configuration files for computer cluster environments (skip on single machines):
    + *`.batchtools.conf.R`*: defines the type of scheduler for *`batchtools`* pointing to template file of cluster, and located in user's home directory
    + *`*.tmpl`*: specifies parameters of scheduler used by a system, *e.g.* Torque, SGE, Slurm, etc.

### Structure of _`targets`_ file

The _`targets`_ file defines all input files (_e.g._ FASTQ, BAM, BCF) and
sample comparisons of an analysis workflow. The following shows the format of a
sample _`targets`_ file included in the package. It also can be viewed and
downloaded from _`systemPipeR`_'s GitHub repository
[here](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeR/blob/master/inst/extdata/targets.txt).
In a target file with a single type of input files, here FASTQ files of
single-end (SE) reads, the first three columns are mandatory including their
column names, while it is four mandatory columns for FASTQ files of PE reads.
All subsequent columns are optional and any number of additional columns can be
added as needed. The columns in targets files are expected to be tab separated (TSV format). 
The `SampleName` column contains usually short labels for
referencing samples (here FASTQ files) accross many workflow steps (_e.g._
plots and column titles). Importantly, the labels used in the `SampleName`
column need to be unique, while technical or biological replicates are
indicated by duplicated values under the `Factor` column. For readability 
and transparency, it is useful to use here a short, consistent and informative
syntax for naming samples and replicates. To avoid problems with other
packages or external software, it is recommended to use the basic naming rules
for R objects and their components as outlined [here](https://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/GEN242/tutorials/rbasics/rbasics/#data-objects).
This is important since the values used under the `SampleName` and `Factor`
columns are intended to be used as labels for naming columns or plotting features 
in downstream analysis steps.

Users should note here, the usage of targets files is optional when using
*systemPipeR's* new CWL interface. They can be replaced by a standard YAML
input file used by CWL. Since for organizing experimental variables targets
files are extremely useful and user-friendly. Thus, we encourage users to keep using 
them. 

#### Structure of _`targets`_ file for single-end (SE) samples

```{r targetsSE, eval=TRUE}
library(systemPipeR)
targetspath <- system.file("extdata", "targets.txt", package="systemPipeR") 
read.delim(targetspath, comment.char = "#")[1:4,]
```

To work with custom data, users need to generate a _`targets`_ file containing 
the paths to their own FASTQ files and then provide under _`targetspath`_ the
path to the corresponding _`targets`_ file. 

#### Structure of _`targets`_ file for paired-end (PE) samples

For paired-end (PE) samples, the structure of the targets file is similar, where
users need to provide two FASTQ path columns: *`FileName1`* and *`FileName2`* 
with the paths to the PE FASTQ files. 

```{r targetsPE, eval=TRUE}
targetspath <- system.file("extdata", "targetsPE.txt", package="systemPipeR")
read.delim(targetspath, comment.char = "#")[1:2,1:6]
```

#### Sample comparisons

Sample comparisons are defined in the header lines of the _`targets`_ file 
starting with '``# <CMP>``'. 

```{r comment_lines, echo=TRUE}
readLines(targetspath)[1:4]
```

The function _`readComp`_ imports the comparison information and stores it in a 
_`list`_. Alternatively, _`readComp`_ can obtain the comparison information from 
the corresponding _`SYSargs`_ object (see below). Note, these header lines are 
optional. They are mainly useful for controlling comparative analyses according 
to certain biological expectations, such as identifying differentially expressed
genes in RNA-Seq experiments based on simple pair-wise comparisons.
 
```{r targetscomp, eval=TRUE}
readComp(file=targetspath, format="vector", delim="-")
```

### Structure and initialization of _`SYSargs2`_ 

_`SYSargs2`_ stores all the information and instructions needed for processing
a set of input files with a single or many command-line steps within a workflow
(*i.e.* several components of the software or several independent software tools).
The _`SYSargs2`_ object is created and fully populated with the *loadWF* 
and *renderWF* functions, respectively. 

In CWL, files with the extension *`.cwl`* define the parameters of a chosen 
command-line step or workflow, while files with the extension *`.yml`* define 
the input variables of command-line steps. Note, input variables provided
by a *targets* file can be passed on to a _`SYSargs2`_ instance via the *inputvars* 
argument of the *renderWF* function. 

```{r CWL_structure, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
hisat2.cwl <- system.file("extdata", "cwl/hisat2/hisat2-se/hisat2-mapping-se.cwl", package="systemPipeR")
yaml::read_yaml(hisat2.cwl)
```

```{r yaml_structure, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
hisat2.yml <- system.file("extdata", "cwl/hisat2/hisat2-se/hisat2-mapping-se.yml", package="systemPipeR")
yaml::read_yaml(hisat2.yml)
```

The following imports a *`.cwl`* file (here *`hisat2-mapping-se.cwl`*) for running
the short read aligner HISAT2 [@Kim2015-ve]. The *loadWF* and *renderWF* 
functions render the proper command-line strings for each sample and software tool.

```{r SYSargs2_structure, eval=TRUE}
library(systemPipeR)
targets <- system.file("extdata", "targets.txt", package="systemPipeR")
dir_path <- system.file("extdata/cwl/hisat2/hisat2-se", package="systemPipeR")
WF <- loadWF(targets=targets, wf_file="hisat2-mapping-se.cwl",
                   input_file="hisat2-mapping-se.yml",
                   dir_path=dir_path)

WF <- renderWF(WF, inputvars=c(FileName="_FASTQ_PATH1_", SampleName="_SampleName_"))
```

Several accessor methods are available that are named after the slot names of the _`SYSargs2`_ object. 

```{r names_WF, eval=TRUE}
names(WF)
```

Of particular interest is the *`cmdlist()`* method. It constructs the system
commands for running command-line software as specified by a given *`.cwl`*
file combined with the paths to the input samples (*e.g.* FASTQ files) provided
by a *`targets`* file. The example below shows the *`cmdlist()`* output for
running HISAT2 on the first SE read sample. Evaluating the output of
*`cmdlist()`* can be very helpful for designing and debugging *`.cwl`* files
of new command-line software or changing the parameter settings of existing
ones.  

```{r cmdlist, eval=TRUE}
cmdlist(WF)[1]
```

The output components of _`SYSargs2`_ define the expected output files for 
each step in the workflow; some of which are the input for the next workflow step, 
here next _`SYSargs2`_ instance (see Figure 2).

```{r output_WF, eval=TRUE}
output(WF)[1]
modules(WF)
targets(WF)[1]
targets.as.df(targets(WF))[1:4,1:4]
output(WF)[1]
inputvars(WF)
```

In an 'R-centric' rather than a 'CWL-centric' workflow design the connectivity
among workflow steps is established by writing all relevant output with the
*writeTargetsout* function to a new targets file that serves as input to the
next *loadWorkflow* and *renderWF* call. By chaining several _`SYSargs2`_ steps
together one can construct complex workflows involving many sample-level
input/output file operations with any combination of command-line or R-based
software. Alternatively, a CWL-centric workflow design can be used that defines
all/most workflow steps with CWL workflow and parameter files. Due to time and
space restrictions, the CWL-centric approach is not covered by this tutorial. 

#### Third-party software tools {#tools}

Current, *systemPipeR* provides the _`param`_ file templates for third-party software tools. 
A list is provided in the following table.

```{r table_tools, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
# library(kableExtra)
SPR_software <- system.file("extdata", "SPR_software.csv", package="systemPipeR")
#SPR_software <- "SPR_software.csv"
software <- read.delim(SPR_software, sep=",", comment.char = "#")
colors <- colorRampPalette((c("darkseagreen", "indianred1")))(length(unique(software$Category)))
id <- as.numeric(c((unique(software$Category))))
software %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Step = kableExtra::cell_spec(Step, color = "white", bold = TRUE,
    background = factor(Category, id, colors)
  )) %>%
   dplyr::select(Tool, Description, Step) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(Tool) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable(escape = FALSE, align = "c", col.names = c("Tool Name",	"Description", "Step")) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), full_width = TRUE) %>%
  kableExtra::scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "500px")
```

Remember, if you desire to run any of these tools, make sure to have the respective software installed on your system and configure in the PATH. You can check as follows: 

```{r test_tool_path, eval=FALSE}
tryCL(command="grep") 
```

## How to run a Workflow

This tutorial introduces the basic ideas and tools needed to build a specific workflow from preconfigured templates.

### Load sample data and workflow templates

```{r workflow, eval=FALSE}
library(systemPipeRdata)
genWorkenvir(workflow="rnaseq")
setwd("rnaseq")
```

### Setup and Requirements 

To go through this tutorial, you need the following software installed:

* R (version >=3.6.2) 
* systemPipeR package (version >=1.22)
* Hisat2 (version >= 2.1.0)

If you desire to build your pipeline with any different software, make sure to
have the respective software installed and available in your PATH. To make
sure if the configuration is correct, on test it with:

```{r test_software, eval=FALSE}
tryCL(command="hisat2") ## "All set up, proceed!"
```

### Project initialization 

A `SYSargsList` object containing all relevant information for running a workflow
(here RNA-Seq example) can be constructed as follows.

```{r initwf, eval=FALSE}
getwd() ## rnaseq
script <- "systemPipeRNAseq.Rmd"
targetspath <- "targets.txt"
sysargslist <- initWF(script = script, targets = targetspath)
```

### Workflow execution

To run workflows from R, there are several possibilities. First, one can run 
each line in an `Rmd` or `R` interactively, or use the `runWF` functions that 
allows to run workflows step-wise or from start to finish. 


```{r config, eval=FALSE}
sysargslist <- configWF(x=sysargslist, input_steps = "1:3")
sysargslist <- runWF(sysargslist = sysargslist, steps = "1:2")
```

Alternatively, R pipes (*%>%*) are supported to run individual workflow steps. 

```{r pipes, eval=FALSE}
sysargslist <- initWF(script ="systemPipeRNAseq.Rmd", overwrite = TRUE) %>%
    configWF(input_steps = "1:3") %>%
    runWF(steps = "1:2")
```

### How to run the workflow on a cluster

This section of the tutorial provides an introduction to the usage of the *systemPipeR* features on a cluster. 

Now open the R markdown script `*.Rmd`in your R IDE (_e.g._vim-r or RStudio) and run the workflow as outlined below. If you work under Vim-R-Tmux, the following command sequence will connect the user in an
interactive session with a node on the cluster. The code of the `Rmd`
script can then be sent from Vim on the login (head) node to an open R session running
on the corresponding computer node. This is important since Tmux sessions
should not be run on the computer nodes. 

```{r closeR, eval=FALSE}
q("no") # closes R session on head node
```

```{bash node_environment, eval=FALSE}
srun --x11 --partition=short --mem=2gb --cpus-per-task 4 --ntasks 1 --time 2:00:00 --pty bash -l
module load R/4.0.3
R
```

Now check whether your R session is running on a computer node of the cluster and not on a head node.

```{r r_environment, eval=FALSE}
system("hostname") # should return name of a compute node starting with i or c 
getwd() # checks current working directory of R session
dir() # returns content of current working directory
```

#### Parallelization on clusters

Alternatively, the computation can be greatly accelerated by processing many files 
in parallel using several compute nodes of a cluster, where a scheduling/queuing
system is used for load balancing. For this the *`clusterRun`* function submits 
the computing requests to the scheduler using the run specifications
defined by *`runCommandline`*. 

To avoid over-subscription of CPU cores on the compute nodes, the value from 
_`yamlinput(args)['thread']`_ is passed on to the submission command, here _`ncpus`_ 
in the _`resources`_ list object. The number of independent parallel cluster 
processes is defined under the _`Njobs`_ argument. The following example will run 
18 processes in parallel using for each 4 CPU cores. If the resources available
on a cluster allow running all 18 processes at the same time then the shown sample 
submission will utilize in total 72 CPU cores. Note, *`clusterRun`* can be used
with most queueing systems as it is based on utilities from the _`batchtools`_ 
package which supports the use of template files (_`*.tmpl`_) for defining the 
run parameters of different schedulers. To run the following code, one needs to 
have both a conf file (see _`.batchtools.conf.R`_ samples [here](https://mllg.github.io/batchtools/)) 
and a template file (see _`*.tmpl`_ samples [here](https://github.com/mllg/batchtools/tree/master/inst/templates)) 
for the queueing available on a system. The following example uses the sample 
conf and template files for the Slurm scheduler provided by this package.  

```{r clusterRun, eval=FALSE}
library(batchtools)
targetspath <- system.file("extdata", "targetsPE.txt", package="systemPipeR")
dir_path <- system.file("extdata/cwl/hisat2/hisat2-pe", package="systemPipeR")

## Workflow initialization with templates

Workflow templates are provided via `systemPipeRdata` and GitHub. Instances of these 
workflows can be created with a single command. 

### RNA-Seq sample

Load the RNA-Seq sample workflow into your current working directory.

```{r genRna_workflow_single, eval=FALSE}
library(systemPipeRdata)
genWorkenvir(workflow="rnaseq")
setwd("rnaseq")
```

#### Run workflow

Next, run the chosen sample workflow _`systemPipeRNAseq`_ ([PDF](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/rnaseq/systemPipeRNAseq.pdf?raw=true), [Rmd](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/rnaseq/systemPipeRNAseq.Rmd)) by executing from the command-line _`make -B`_ within the _`rnaseq`_ directory. Alternatively, one can run the code from the provided _`*.Rmd`_ template file from within R interactively. 

The workflow includes following steps:

1. Read preprocessing
    + Quality filtering (trimming)
    + FASTQ quality report
2. Alignments: _`Tophat2`_ (or any other RNA-Seq aligner)
3. Alignment stats 
4. Read counting 
5. Sample-wise correlation analysis
6. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
7. GO term enrichment analysis
8. Gene-wise clustering

### ChIP-Seq sample

Load the ChIP-Seq sample workflow into your current working directory.

```{r genChip_workflow_single, eval=FALSE}
library(systemPipeRdata)
genWorkenvir(workflow="chipseq")
setwd("chipseq")
```

#### Run workflow

Next, run the chosen sample workflow _`systemPipeChIPseq_single`_ ([PDF](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/chipseq/systemPipeChIPseq.pdf?raw=true), [Rmd](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/chipseq/systemPipeChIPseq.Rmd)) by executing from the command-line _`make -B`_ within the _`chipseq`_ directory. Alternatively, one can run the code from the provided _`*.Rmd`_ template file from within R interactively. 

The workflow includes the following steps:

1. Read preprocessing
    + Quality filtering (trimming)
    + FASTQ quality report
2. Alignments: _`Bowtie2`_ or _`rsubread`_
3. Alignment stats 
4. Peak calling: _`MACS2`_, _`BayesPeak`_ 
5. Peak annotation with genomic context
6. Differential binding analysis
7. GO term enrichment analysis
8. Motif analysis

### VAR-Seq sample 

#### VAR-Seq workflow for the single machine

Load the VAR-Seq sample workflow into your current working directory.

```{r genVar_workflow_single, eval=FALSE}
library(systemPipeRdata)
genWorkenvir(workflow="varseq")
setwd("varseq")
```

#### Run workflow

Next, run the chosen sample workflow _`systemPipeVARseq_single`_ ([PDF](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/varseq/systemPipeVARseq_single.pdf?raw=true), [Rmd](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/varseq/systemPipeVARseq_single.Rmd)) by executing from the command-line _`make -B`_ within the _`varseq`_ directory. Alternatively, one can run the code from the provided _`*.Rmd`_ template file from within R interactively. 

The workflow includes following steps:

1. Read preprocessing
    + Quality filtering (trimming)
    + FASTQ quality report
2. Alignments: _`gsnap`_, _`bwa`_
3. Variant calling: _`VariantTools`_, _`GATK`_, _`BCFtools`_
4. Variant filtering: _`VariantTools`_ and _`VariantAnnotation`_
5. Variant annotation: _`VariantAnnotation`_
6. Combine results from many samples
7. Summary statistics of samples

#### VAR-Seq workflow for computer cluster

The workflow template provided for this step is called _`systemPipeVARseq.Rmd`_ ([PDF](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/varseq/systemPipeVARseq.pdf?raw=true), [Rmd](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/varseq/systemPipeVARseq.Rmd)).
It runs the above VAR-Seq workflow in parallel on multiple compute nodes of an HPC system using Slurm as the scheduler. 

### Ribo-Seq sample

Load the Ribo-Seq sample workflow into your current working directory.

```{r genRibo_workflow_single, eval=FALSE}
library(systemPipeRdata)
genWorkenvir(workflow="riboseq")
setwd("riboseq")
```

#### Run workflow

Next, run the chosen sample workflow _`systemPipeRIBOseq`_ ([PDF](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/riboseq/systemPipeRIBOseq.pdf?raw=true), [Rmd](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/ribseq/systemPipeRIBOseq.Rmd)) by executing from the command-line _`make -B`_ within the _`ribseq`_ directory. Alternatively, one can run the code from the provided _`*.Rmd`_ template file from within R interactively. 

The workflow includes following steps:

1. Read preprocessing
    + Adaptor trimming and quality filtering
    + FASTQ quality report
2. Alignments: _`Tophat2`_ (or any other RNA-Seq aligner)
3. Alignment stats
4. Compute read distribution across genomic features
5. Adding custom features to the workflow (e.g. uORFs)
6. Genomic read coverage along with transcripts
7. Read counting 
8. Sample-wise correlation analysis
9. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
10. GO term enrichment analysis
11. Gene-wise clustering
12. Differential ribosome binding (translational efficiency)
