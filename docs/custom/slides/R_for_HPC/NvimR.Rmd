## Introduction to Nvim-R-Tmux

- <b><font color="red">Note:</font></b> the content on the following slides is also available in this tutorial section [here](https://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/GEN242/tutorials/linux/linux/#textcode-editors).
- The examples are assuming that users are logged into their HPCC cluster account, or are working on a system where vim/nvim is accessible via a terminal.
- The following introduces Nvim-R combined with Tmux. 
- Similar instructions are available in HPCC's Nvim-R-Tmux tutorial [here](http://hpcc.ucr.edu/manuals_linux-cluster_terminalIDE.html).
- Note: Nvim-R and Tmux are two separate tools that can be used independently or in combination, and both are useful for remote terminal work. 
- For simplicity, some of the following examples use Nvim-R without Tmux. Once users know the basics of both then it is trivial to combine them as needed. 


## Vim/Nvim Basics

The following opens a file (here `myfile.txt`) with nvim (or vim). This can be a new file or an existing one. 

```{bash eval=FALSE}
nvim myfile.txt # for neovim (or 'vim myfile.txt' for vim)
```

### Modes

In Vim/Nvim there are three main modes: __normal__, __insert__ and __command__ mode. The most important commands for switching between the three modes are:

* `i`: switches from the normal to the insert mode. The latter is used for typing. 
* `Esc`: switches from the insert mode back to the normal mode.
* `:`: starts the command mode (from normal mode) at the bottom of the terminal window.

The cursor is moved with the arrow keys. In Nvim one can also enable mouse-based movements of the cursor. `Fn Up/Down` allows to page. In the following, all 
commands starting with `:` need to be typed in the command mode. All other commands are typed in the normal mode after pushing the `Esc` key. 

<p style='text-align: right;'> __[ Scroll down to continue ]__ </p>
<br/><br/>

### Important modifier keys to control Vim/Nvim

* `:w`: saves changes to file. If in editing mode, `Esc` needs to be pressed first.
* `:q`: quits file that has not been changed; use `q!` to quit file without saving changes.
* `:wq`: saves and quits file

### Useful resources for learning Vim/Nvim

* [Interactive Vim Tutorial](http://www.openvim.com)
* [Official Vim Documentation](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/)
* [HPCC Linux Manual](http://hpcc.ucr.edu/manuals_linux-basics_vim.html)

## Quick Nvim-R Demo (details on next slides)

To try out the following instructions, users want to log into their HPCC
account via `ssh`, and then preferentially connect to a node by initializing an
interactive `srun` session. The latter mimics the best practices for a real workflow 
but is not necessary for this basic exercise. If Nvim-R is not installed in a user's
account yet, then configure it with the `Install_Nvim-R_Tmux` command as outlined [here](https://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/GEN242/custom/slides/R_for_HPC/NvimR.html#13).

```{bash eval=FALSE}
srun --x11 --partition=short --mem=2gb --cpus-per-task 4 --ntasks 1 --time 1:00:00 --pty bash -l
```

- Under `--partition` it is important to assign the name of a partition a user has access to 
    - Most users have access to: `short`, `batch`, `intel` and `highmem` 
    - Users of labs owning computer nodes also can access: `<pi_name>lab` 
- For more details on argument settings for `srun`, see [here](http://hpcc.ucr.edu/manuals_linux-cluster_jobs.html)

Download `R_for_HPC_demo.R` or `nvimr_demo.R` file to you HPCC account as follows.  

```{bash eval=FALSE}
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tgirke/GEN242/main/static/custom/slides/R_for_HPC/demo_files/R_for_HPC_demo.R
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tgirke/GEN242/main/static/custom/slides/R_for_HPC/demo_files/nvimr_demo.R
```

<p style='text-align: right;'> __[ Scroll down to continue ]__ </p>
<br/><br/>

Open `R_for_HPC_demo.R` or `nvim_demo.R` with nvim. The content of `R_for_HPC_demo.R` file is shown in the following code 
block. Next, initialize a Nvim-connected R session with `\rf`, and then execute the 
code by pressing the space bar on your keyboard. 

```{r nvim-r-tmux-demo_show, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

    group_by(Species) %>%                                                                                                                                                     
    summarize_all(mean) %>%                                                                                                                                                   
    reshape2::melt(id.vars=c("Species"), variable.name = "Samples", value.name="Values") %>%                                                                                  
    ggplot(aes(Samples, Values, fill = Species)) +

## Tmux for Managing Terminal Sessions

### What is Tmux?

- Tmux is a virtual terminal multiplexer providing re-attachable terminal sessions
- Advantage: work in a terminal session cannot get lost due to internet disruptions or even when switching computers
- Combined with the `Nvim-r` plugin it provides a flexible working environment for R 
- Users can send code from a script to the R console or command-line.
- On HPCC both Nvim-R and Tmux are pre-configured and easy to install 

<center><img title="Nvim-R" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R/master/Nvim-R.gif" style="width:400px;"></center>

</br></br></br></br>

## Nvim-R-Tmux Configuration in HPCC User Accounts

Skip these steps if Nvim-R-Tmux is already configured in your account. Or follow the [detailed
instructions](https://github.com/tgirke/Nvim-R_Tmux) to install Nvim-R-Tmux from scratch on your own system (_e.g._ laptop or computer).

__1.__ Log in to your user account on HPCC and execute on the command-line: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
Install_Nvim-R_Tmux 
```
__2.__ To enable the nvim-R-tmux environment, log out and in again.

__3.__ Follow usage instructions of next section.

## Typical Usage Workflow for Nvim-R-Tmux


__1. Start tmux session from login node (not compute node!)__

Running Nvim from tmux provides reattachment functionality. Skip this step if this is not required.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
tmux # starts a new tmux session 
tmux a # attaches to an existing or preconfigured session 
```

__2. Open nvim-connected R session__ 

Open a `*.R` or `*.Rmd` file with `nvim` and initialize a connected R session
with `\rf`. Note, the resulting split window among Nvim and R behaves like a split
viewport in `nvim` or `vim` meaning the usage of `Ctrl-w w` followed by `i` and
`Esc` is important for session navigation.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
nvim myscript.R # or *.Rmd file
```

__3. Send R code from nvim to the R pane__

Single lines of code can be sent from nvim to the R console by pressing the space bar. To send 
several lines at once, one can select them in nvim's visual mode and then hit the space bar. 

<p style='text-align: right;'> __[ Scroll down to continue ]__ </p>
<br/><br/>

- Please note, the default command for sending code lines in the nvim-r-plugin is `\l`. This key 
  binding has been remapped in the provided `.config/nvim/init.vim` file to the
  space bar. Most other key bindings (shortcuts) still start with the `\` as
  LocalLeader, _e.g._ `\rh` opens the help for a function/object where the cursor
  is located in nvim. More details on this are given on the next slide(s).
- The most comprehensive manual on this is the official `Nvim-R` documentation [here](https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R/blob/master/doc/Nvim-R.txt).

## Keybindings to Control Environment

### Important keybindings for nvim

* `\rf`: opens vim-connected R session. If you do this the first time in your user account, you might be asked to create an `R` directory under `~/`. If so approve this action by pressing `y`. 
* `spacebar`: sends code from vim to R; here remapped in `init.vim` from default `\l`
* `:split` or `:vsplit`: splits viewport (similar to pane split in tmux)
* `gz`: maximizes size of viewport in normal mode (similar to Tmux's `Ctrl-a z` zoom utility) 
* `Ctrl-w w`: jumps cursor to R viewport and back; toggle between insert (`i`) and command (`Esc`) mode is required for navigation and controlling the environment.
* `Ctrl-w r`: swaps viewports
* `Ctrl-w =`: resizes splits to equal size
* `:resize <+5 or -5>`: resizes height by specified value
* `:set mouse=a`: enables mouse support and `: set mouse-=a` disables it

<br/><br/>
<p style='text-align: right;'> __[ Scroll down to continue ]__ </p>
<br/><br/><br/><br/>

* `:vertical resize <+5 or -5>`: resizes width by specified value
* `Ctrl-w H` or `Ctrl-w K`: toggles between horizontal/vertical splits
* `Ctrl-spacebar`: omni completion for R objects/functions when nvim is in insert mode. Note, this has been remapped in `init.vim` from difficult to type default `Ctrl-x Ctrl-o`. 
* `:h nvim-R`: opens nvim-R's user manual; navigation works the same as for any Vim/Nvim help document
* `:Rhelp fct_name`: opens help for a function from nvim's command mode with text completion support
* `Ctrl-s and Ctrl-x`: freezes/unfreezes vim (some systems)


### Important keybindings for tmux

__Pane-level commands__

* `Ctrl-a %`: splits pane vertically
* `Ctrl-a "`: splits pane horizontally
* `Ctrl-a o`: jumps cursor to next pane
* `Ctrl-a Ctrl-o`: swaps panes
* `Ctrl-a <space bar>`: rotates pane arrangement
* `Ctrl-a Alt <left or right>`: resizes to left or right
* `Ctrl-a Esc <up or down>`: resizes to left or right

__Window-level comands__

* `Ctrl-a n`: switches to next tmux window 
* `Ctrl-a Ctrl-a`: switches to previous tmux window
* `Ctrl-a c`: creates a new tmux window 
* `Ctrl-a 1`: switches to specific tmux window selected by number

__Session-level comands__

* `Ctrl-a d`: detaches from current session
* `Ctrl-a s`: switch between available tmux sessions
* `$ tmux new -s <name>`: starts new session with a specific name
* `$ tmux ls`: lists available tmux session(s)
* `$ tmux attach -t <id>`: attaches to specific tmux session  
* `$ tmux attach`: reattaches to session 
* `$ tmux kill-session -t <id>`: kills a specific tmux session
* `Ctrl-a : kill-session`: kills a session from tmux command mode 

## Use Same Environment for Other Languages

### Basics

For languages other than R one can use the
[vimcmdline](https://github.com/jalvesaq/vimcmdline) plugin for nvim (or vim).
Supported languages include Bash, Python, Golang, Haskell, JavaScript, Julia,
Jupyter, Lisp, Macaulay2, Matlab, Prolog, Ruby, and Sage. The nvim terminal
also colorizes the output, as in the screenshot below, where different colors
are used for general output, positive and negative numbers, and the prompt
line.

<center><img title="vimcmdline" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/891655/7090493/5fba2426-df71-11e4-8eb8-f17668d9361a.png" ></center>
<center>vimcmdline</center>

### Install

To install it, one needs to copy from the `vimcmdline` repository the directories
`ftplugin`, `plugin` and `syntax` and their files to `~/.config/nvim/`. For
user accounts of UCR’s HPCC, the above install script `Install_Nvim-R_Tmux` includes the 
install of `vimcmdline` (since 09-Jun-18).

### Usage

The usage of `vimcmdline` is very similar to `nvim-R`. To start a connected terminal session, one
opens with nvim a code file with the extension of a given language (_e.g._ `*.sh` for Bash or `*.py` for Python), 
while the corresponding interactive interpreter session is initiated
by pressing the key sequence `\s` (corresponds to `\rf` under `nvim-R`). Subsequently, code lines can be sent 
with the space bar. More details are available [here](https://github.com/jalvesaq/vimcmdline). 


## Selecting R Versions on HPCC

- Like many other software tools, R versions are managed under HPCC's module system. 
- To use a specific R version in Nvim-R, one simply loads it prior to starting Nvim. Instructions
  for enabling additional R version toggle options are provided [here](https://github.com/tgirke/Nvim-R_Tmux#rversion_toggle).

Which R versions are available can be listed with the following command.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
module avail R
```

The version labeled `default` is used by default. A specific R version can be loaded as follows.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
module load R/4.1.2
```

Check which modules (including R) are loaded in a user's environment.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
module list
```
