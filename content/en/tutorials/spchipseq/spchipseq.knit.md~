## Introduction

The following analyzes the ChIP-Seq data from Kaufman et al. [-@Kaufmann2010-me] using 
for peak calling MACS2 where the uninduced sample serves as input (reference). Prior to running
this analysis the corresponding FASTQ files need to be downloaded following the instructions
[here](https://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/GEN242/assignments/projects/project_data/). 

For learning purposes one can use the much smaller toy data set and ChIP-Seq `Rmd`
workflow instance provided by the `systemPipeRdata` package. This toy workflow instance 
can be conveniently obtained by running `genWorkenvir(workflow='chipseq')` (see
below). The FASTQ data used for this toy instance are the same as for the
RNA-Seq workflow, but the analysis code in the `Rmd` file is almost identical
to the ChIP-Seq workflow below. 

For the analysis of the Kaufman et al. [-@Kaufmann2010-me] data set (see download [here](https://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/GEN242/assignments/projects/project_data/))
users want to use the `Rmd` instance linked from the top right corner of this page. 
Additional detail about this is provided [here](https://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/GEN242/assignments/projects/project_data/#workflow-rmd-file).

### Experimental design

Typically, users want to specify here all information relevant for the
analysis of their NGS study. This includes detailed descriptions of
FASTQ files, experimental design, reference genome, gene annotations,
etc.

### Workflow environment

<font color="red">NOTE: this section</font> describes how to set up the proper 
environment (directory structure) for running `systemPipeR` workflows. After 
mastering this task the workflow run instructions <font color="red">can be deleted</font> 
since they are not expected to be included in a final HTML/PDF report of a workflow.

1. If a remote system or cluster is used, then users need to log in to the
   remote system first. The following applies to an HPC cluster (_e.g._ HPCC
   cluster). 

   A terminal application needs to be used to log in to a user's cluster account. Next, one
   can open an interactive session on a computer node with `srun --x11`. More details about
   argument settings for `srun` are available in this [HPCC
   manual](http://hpcc.ucr.edu/manuals_linux-cluster_jobs.html#partitions) or
   the HPCC section of this website
   [here](https://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/GEN242/tutorials/linux/linux/#job-submission-with-sbatch).
   Next, load the R version required for running the workflow with `module load`. Sometimes it may be necessary to
   first unload an active software version before loading another version, _e.g._ `module unload R`.

1. If a remote system or cluster is used, then users need to log in to the
   remote system first. The following applies to an HPC cluster (_e.g._ HPCC
   cluster). 

   A terminal application needs to be used to log in to a user's cluster account. Next, one

   the HPCC section of this website
   [here](https://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/GEN242/tutorials/linux/linux/#job-submission-with-sbatch).
   Next, load the R version required for running the workflow with `module load`. Sometimes it may be necessary to
   first unload an active software version before loading another version, _e.g._ `module unload R`.


```bash
srun --x11 --partition=gen242 --mem=20gb --cpus-per-task 8 --ntasks 1 --time 20:00:00 --pty bash -l
module unload R; module load R/4.1.2
```

2. Load a workflow template with the `genWorkenvir` function. This can be done from the command-line or from within R. 
   However, only one of the two options needs to be used.

From command-line


```bash
$ Rscript -e "systemPipeRdata::genWorkenvir(workflow='chipseq')"
$ cd chipseq
```

From R


```r
library(systemPipeRdata)
genWorkenvir(workflow = "chipseq")
setwd("chipseq")
```

3. Optional: if the user wishes to use another `Rmd` file than the template 
instance provided by the `genWorkenvir` function, then it can be copied or downloaded 
into the root directory of the workflow environment (_e.g._ with `cp` or `wget`).

4. Now one can open from the root directory of the workflow the corresponding 
R Markdown script (_e.g._ systemPipeChIPseq.Rmd) using an R IDE, such as _nvim-r_, 
_ESS_ or RStudio. Subsequently, the workflow can be run as outlined below. For 
learning purposes it is recommended to run workflows for the first time interactively. 
Once all workflow steps are understood and possibly modified to custom needs, 
one can run the workflow from start to finish with a single command using `runWF()`.

### Load packages

The `systemPipeR` package needs to be loaded to perform the analysis 
steps shown in this report [@H_Backman2016-bt]. The package allows users
to run the entire analysis workflow interactively or with a single command 
while also generating the corresponding analysis report. For details
see `systemPipeR's` main [vignette](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/systemPipeR/inst/doc/systemPipeR.html).


```r
library(systemPipeR)
```

To apply workflows to custom data, the user needs to modify the _`targets`_ file and if
necessary update the corresponding parameter (_`.cwl`_ and _`.yml`_) files. 
A collection of pre-generated _`.cwl`_ and _`.yml`_ files are provided in the _`param/cwl`_ subdirectory 
of each workflow template. They are also viewable in the GitHub repository of _`systemPipeRdata`_ ([see
here](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/tree/master/inst/extdata/param/cwl)).
For more information of the structure of the *targets* file, please consult the documentation 
[here](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/systemPipeR/inst/doc/systemPipeR.html#25_structure_of_targets_file). More details about the new parameter files from `systemPipeR` can be found [here](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/systemPipeR/inst/doc/systemPipeR.html#26_structure_of_the_new_param_files_and_construct_sysargs2_container). 

### Import custom functions

Custom functions for the challenge projects can be imported with the source
command from a local R script (here [challengeProject_Fct.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tgirke/GEN242//main/content/en/tutorials/spchipseq/challengeProject_Fct.R)). Skip this step if such a script is not available. Alternatively, 
these functions can be loaded from a custom R package. 


```r
source("challengeProject_Fct.R")
```

### Experiment definition provided by `targets` file

The `targets` file defines all FASTQ files and sample comparisons of the analysis workflow. 
If needed the tab separated (TSV) version of this file can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/tgirke/GEN242/tree/main/content/en/assignments/Projects/targets_files)
and the corresponding Google Sheet is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w9V3JDOsXR8qW_qNqoXO0E0UR_Oev4k7-o2y6NMDTt8/edit#gid=472150521).


```r
targetspath <- "targets_chipseq.txt"
targets <- read.delim(targetspath, comment.char = "#")
knitr::kable(targets)
```

## Workflow steps

This tutorial will demonstrate how to either build and run the workflow automatically, 
or in an interactive mode by appending each step with the `appendStep` method. In both
cases the `SYSargsList` object will be populated with the instructions for running each
workflow step, while supporting both command-line steps as well as line-wise R commands 
defined in the corresponding code chunks of this or any `Rmd` file that has been properly
formatted.

To create a workflow within _`systemPipeR`_, we can start by defining an empty
`SYSargsList` container. When restarting an existing workflow one
can set `resume=TRUE` under the `SPRproject()` function call. 


```r
library(systemPipeR)
sal <- SPRproject()
```

```
## Creating directory:  /home/tgirke/tmp/GEN242/content/en/tutorials/spchipseq/data 
## Creating directory '/home/tgirke/tmp/GEN242/content/en/tutorials/spchipseq/.SPRproject'
## Creating file '/home/tgirke/tmp/GEN242/content/en/tutorials/spchipseq/.SPRproject/SYSargsList.yml'
```

```r
sal
```

```
## Instance of 'SYSargsList': 
##  No workflow steps added
```

Next, the `importWF` function will load the entire workflow into the `SYSargsList` object
(here `sal`). Subsequently, the `runWF()` function will run the workflow from start to finish. 
If needed, specific workflow steps can be executed by assigning their corresponding
position numbers within the workflow to the `steps` argument (see `?runWF`). After completion of the workflow
one can render a scientific analysis report in HTML format with the `renderReport()` 
function that uses R Markdown internally.


```r
sal <- importWF(sal, file_path = "systemPipeChIPseq.Rmd")  ## Import all the Workflow steps
sal
sal <- runWF(sal)  # Runs workflow
sal <- renderReport(sal)  # Renders report
```

### Required packages and resources

The `systemPipeR` package needs to be loaded [@H_Backman2016-bt].


```r
appendStep(sal) <- LineWise(code = {
    library(systemPipeR)
}, step_name = "load_SPR")
```

### Read preprocessing

#### Read quality filtering and trimming

The function `preprocessReads` allows to apply predefined or custom
read preprocessing functions to all FASTQ files referenced in a
`SYSargsList` container, such as quality filtering or adapter trimming
routines. The paths to the resulting output FASTQ files are stored in the
`outfiles` slot of the `SYSargsList` object. The following example performs adapter trimming with
the `trimLRPatterns` function from the `Biostrings` package.
After the trimming step a new targets file is generated (here
`targets_trim.txt`) containing the paths to the trimmed FASTQ files.
The new targets file can be used for the next workflow step with an updated
`SYSargs2` instance, _e.g._ running the NGS alignments using the
trimmed FASTQ files.

Here, we are appending this step to the `SYSargsList` object created previously. 
All the parameters are defined on the `preprocessReads/preprocessReads-pe.yml` and 
`preprocessReads/preprocessReads-pe.cwl` files.


```r
appendStep(sal) <- SYSargsList(step_name = "preprocessing", targets = "targets_chipseq.txt",
    dir = TRUE, wf_file = "preprocessReads/preprocessReads-se.cwl",
    input_file = "preprocessReads/preprocessReads-se.yml", dir_path = "param/cwl",
    inputvars = c(FileName = "_FASTQ_PATH1_", SampleName = "_SampleName_"),
    dependency = c("load_SPR"))
```

After, we can check the `trimLRPatterns` function in input parameter:


```r
yamlinput(sal, "preprocessing")$Fct
```

```
## [1] "'trimLRPatterns(Rpattern=\"GCCCGGGTAA\", subject=fq)'"
```

After the preprocessing step, the `outfiles` files can be used to generate the new 
targets files containing the paths to the trimmed FASTQ files. The new targets 
information can be used for the next workflow step instance, _e.g._ running the 
NGS alignments with the trimmed FASTQ files. The `appendStep` function is
automatically handling this connectivity between steps. Please check the `Alignments` 
step for more details.

#### FASTQ quality report

The following `seeFastq` and `seeFastqPlot` functions generate and plot a series of useful 
quality statistics for a set of FASTQ files including per cycle quality box
plots, base proportions, base-level quality trends, relative k-mer
diversity, length and occurrence distribution of reads, number of reads
above quality cutoffs and mean quality distribution. The results are
written to a PDF file named `fastqReport.pdf`.


```r
appendStep(sal) <- LineWise(code = {
    fastq <- getColumn(sal, step = "preprocessing", "targetsWF",
        column = 1)
    fqlist <- seeFastq(fastq = fastq, batchsize = 10000, klength = 8)
    pdf("./results/fastqReport.pdf", height = 18, width = 4 *
        length(fqlist))
    seeFastqPlot(fqlist)
    dev.off()
}, step_name = "fastq_report", dependency = "preprocessing")
```

### Alignments

#### Read mapping with `Bowtie2` 

The NGS reads of this project will be aligned with `Bowtie2` against the
reference genome sequence [@Langmead2012-bs]. The parameter settings of the
Bowtie2 index are defined in the `bowtie2-index.cwl` and `bowtie2-index.yml` files. 

Building the index:


```r
appendStep(sal) <- SYSargsList(step_name = "bowtie2_index", dir = FALSE,
    targets = NULL, wf_file = "bowtie2/bowtie2-index.cwl", input_file = "bowtie2/bowtie2-index.yml",
    dir_path = "param/cwl", inputvars = NULL, dependency = c("preprocessing"))
```

The parameter settings of the aligner are defined in the `workflow_bowtie2-se.cwl` 
and `workflow_bowtie2-se.yml` files. The following shows how to construct the 
corresponding *SYSargsList* object.

In ChIP-Seq experiments it is usually more appropriate to eliminate reads mapping 
to multiple locations. To achieve this, users want to remove the argument setting 
`-k 50 non-deterministic` in the configuration files.


```r
appendStep(sal) <- SYSargsList(step_name = "bowtie2_alignment",
    dir = TRUE, targets = "targets_chipseq.txt", wf_file = "workflow-bowtie2/workflow_bowtie2-se.cwl",
    input_file = "workflow-bowtie2/workflow_bowtie2-se.yml",
    dir_path = "param/cwl", inputvars = c(FileName = "_FASTQ_PATH1_",
        SampleName = "_SampleName_"), dependency = c("bowtie2_index"))
```

To double-check the command line for each sample, please use the following:


```r
cmdlist(sal, step = "bowtie2_alignment", targets = 1)
```

```
## $bowtie2_alignment
## $bowtie2_alignment$AP1_1
## $bowtie2_alignment$AP1_1$bowtie2
## [1] "bowtie2 -S ./results/AP1_1.sam  -x ./data/tair10.fasta  -k 50  --non-deterministic  -U ./data/SRR038845_1.fastq.gz -p 4"
## 
## $bowtie2_alignment$AP1_1$`samtools-view`
## [1] "samtools view -bS -o ./results/AP1_1.bam  ./results/AP1_1.sam "
## 
## $bowtie2_alignment$AP1_1$`samtools-sort`
## [1] "samtools sort -o ./results/AP1_1.sorted.bam  ./results/AP1_1.bam  -@ 4"
## 
## $bowtie2_alignment$AP1_1$`samtools-index`
## [1] "samtools index -b results/AP1_1.sorted.bam  results/AP1_1.sorted.bam.bai  ./results/AP1_1.sorted.bam "
```

#### Read and alignment stats

The following provides an overview of the number of reads in each sample
and how many of them aligned to the reference.


```r
appendStep(sal) <- LineWise(code = {
    fqpaths <- getColumn(sal, step = "bowtie2_alignment", "targetsWF",
        column = "FileName")
    bampaths <- getColumn(sal, step = "bowtie2_alignment", "outfiles",
        column = "samtools_sort_bam")
    read_statsDF <- alignStats(args = bampaths, fqpaths = fqpaths,
        pairEnd = TRUE)
    write.table(read_statsDF, "results/alignStats.xls", row.names = FALSE,
        quote = FALSE, sep = "\t")
}, step_name = "align_stats", dependency = "bowtie2_alignment")
```

### Create symbolic links for viewing BAM files in IGV

The `symLink2bam` function creates symbolic links to view the BAM alignment
files in a genome browser such as IGV without moving these large files to a
local system. The corresponding URLs are written to a file with a path
specified under `urlfile`, here `IGVurl.txt`. Please replace the directory
and the user name. The following parameter settings will create a
subdirectory under `~/.html` called `somedir` of the user account. The user
name under `urlbase`, here `<username>`, needs to be changed to the corresponding
user name of the person running this function.
