## Overview

One of the main attractions of using the R
([http://cran.at.r-project.org](http://cran.at.r-project.org)) environment is
the ease with which users can write their own programs and custom functions.
The R programming syntax is extremely easy to learn, even for users with no
previous programming experience. Once the basic R programming control
structures are understood, users can use the R language as a powerful
environment to perform complex custom analyses of almost any type of data [@Gentleman2008-xo].

## Control Structures

### Important Operators

#### Comparison operators

* `==` (equal)
* `!=` (not equal)
* `>` (greater than)
* `>=` (greater than or equal)
* `<` (less than)
* `<=` (less than or equal)

#### Logical operators
		
* `&` (and) 
* `&&` (and) 
* `|` (or) 
* `||` (or) 
* `!` (not)

Note: `&` and `&&` indicate logical AND, while `|` and `||` indicate logical OR. The shorter form performs element-wise comparisons of same-length vectors. 
The longer form evaluates left to right examining only the first element of each vector (can be of different lengths). Evaluation proceeds only until the result 
is determined. The longer form is preferred for programming control-flow, _e.g._ via `if` clauses.

### Conditional Executions: `if` Statements

An `if` statement operates on length-one logical vectors.

__Syntax__
```{r if_statement, eval=FALSE}
if (TRUE) { 
    statements_1 
} else { 
    statements_2 
}
```

In the `else` component, avoid inserting newlines between `} else`. For details on how to best and consistently format R code, 
this [style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) is a good start. In addition, the [`formatR`](https://yihui.org/formatr/) package can be helpful.

__Example__
```{r if_statement_example, eval=TRUE}
if (1==0) { 
    print(1) 
} else { 
    print(2) 
}
```

### Conditional Executions: `ifelse` Statements

The `ifelse` statement operates on vectors.

__Syntax__
```{r ifelse_statement, eval=FALSE}
ifelse(test, true_value, false_value)
```
__Example__
```{r ifelse_statement_example, eval=TRUE}
x <- 1:10 
ifelse(x<5, sqrt(x), 0)
```

## Loops

### `for` loop

`for` loops iterate over elements of a looping vector.

__Syntax__
```{r for_loop, eval=FALSE}
for(variable in sequence) { 
	statements 
}
```
__Example__
```{r for_loop_example, eval=TRUE}
mydf <- iris
myve <- NULL
for(i in seq(along=mydf[,1])) {
	myve <- c(myve, mean(as.numeric(mydf[i,1:3])))
}
myve[1:8]
```

__Note:__ Inject into objecs is much faster than append approach with `c`, `cbind`, etc.

__Example__
```{r for_loop_inject_example, eval=TRUE}
myve <- numeric(length(mydf[,1]))
for(i in seq(along=myve)) {
	myve[i] <- mean(as.numeric(mydf[i,1:3]))
}
myve[1:8]
```

#### Conditional Stop of Loops

The `stop` function can be used to break out of a loop (or a function) when a condition becomes `TRUE`. In addition, an error message will be printed.

__Example__
```{r for_loop_stop_example, eval=FALSE}
x <- 1:10
z <- NULL
for(i in seq(along=x)) { 
	if (x[i] < 5) { 
		z <- c(z, x[i]-1)  
	} else { 
		stop("values need to be < 5") 
	}
}
```

### `while` loop

Iterates as long as a condition is true.

__Syntax__
```{r while_loop, eval=FALSE}
while(condition) {
	statements
}
```

__Example__
```{r while_loop_example, eval=TRUE}
z <- 0
while(z<5) { 
	z <- z + 2
	print(z)  
}
```

### The `apply` Function Family

#### `apply`

__Syntax__
```{r apply_loop, eval=FALSE}
apply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ARGs)
```

__Arguments__

* `X`: `array`, `matrix` or `data.frame`
* `MARGIN`: `1` for rows, `2` for columns
* `FUN`: one or more functions
* `ARGs`: possible arguments for functions

__Example__
```{r apply_loop_example, eval=TRUE}
apply(iris[1:8,1:3], 1, mean)
```

#### `tapply`

Applies a function to vector components that are defined by a factor.

__Syntax__
```{r tapply_loop, eval=FALSE}
tapply(vector, factor, FUN)
```

__Example__
```{r tapply_loop_example, eval=TRUE}
iris[1:2,]
tapply(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, mean)
```

#### `sapply`, `lapply` and `vapply`

The iterator functions `sapply`, `lapply` and `vapply` apply a function to
vectors or lists. The `lapply` function always returns a list, while `sapply`
returns `vector` or `matrix` objects when possible. If not then a list is
returned.  The `vapply` function returns a vector or array of type matching the
`FUN.VALUE`. Compared to `sapply`, `vapply` is a safer choice with respect to
controlling specific output types to avoid exception handling problems.

__Examples__
```{r lapply_loop_example, eval=TRUE}
l <- list(a = 1:10, beta = exp(-3:3), logic = c(TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE))
lapply(l, mean)
sapply(l, mean)
vapply(l, mean, FUN.VALUE=numeric(1))
```

Often used in combination with a function definition:
```{r lapply_loop_fct_example, eval=FALSE}
lapply(names(l), function(x) mean(l[[x]]))
sapply(names(l), function(x) mean(l[[x]]))
vapply(names(l), function(x) mean(l[[x]]), FUN.VALUE=numeric(1))
```

### Improving Speed Performance of Loops

Looping over very large data sets can become slow in R. However, this
limitation can be overcome by eliminating certain operations in loops or
avoiding loops over the data intensive dimension in an object altogether. The
latter can be achieved by performing mainly vector-to-vecor or
matrix-to-matrix computations. These vectorized operations run in R often over
100 times faster than the corresponding `for()` or `apply()` loops. In
addition, one can make use of the existing speed-optimized C-level functions in
R, such as `rowSums`, `rowMeans`, `table`, and `tabulate`.  Moreover, one can
design custom functions that avoid expensive R loops by using vector- or
matrix-based approaches. Alternatively, one can write programs that will
perform all time consuming computations on the C-level.

The following code samples illustrate the time-performance differences among 
the different approaches of running iterative operations in R.

#### 1. `for` loop with append versus inject approach

The following runs a `for` loop where the result is appended in each iteration
with the `c()` function. The corresponding `cbind` and `rbind` for two dimensional 
data objects would have a similar performance impact as `c()`.

```{r for_loop_with_c_append, eval=FALSE}
myMA <- matrix(rnorm(1000000), 100000, 10, dimnames=list(1:100000, paste("C", 1:10, sep="")))
results <- NULL
system.time(for(i in seq(along=myMA[,1])) results <- c(results, mean(myMA[i,])))
   user  system elapsed
 39.156   6.369  45.559
```

Now the for loop is run with an inject approach for storing the results in each iteration.

```{r for_loop_with_inject, eval=FALSE}
results <- numeric(length(myMA[,1]))
system.time(for(i in seq(along=myMA[,1])) results[i] <- mean(myMA[i,]))
   user  system elapsed
  1.550   0.005   1.556 
```

As one can see from the output of `system.time`, the inject approach is 20-50 times faster. 

#### 2. `apply` loop versus `rowMeans` 

The following performs a row-wise mean calculation on a large matrix first with an `apply` 
loop and then with the `rowMeans` function.

```{r apply_loop_mean, eval=FALSE}
system.time(myMAmean <- apply(myMA, 1, mean))
  user  system elapsed
 1.452   0.005   1.456

system.time(myMAmean <- rowMeans(myMA))
   user  system elapsed
  0.005   0.001   0.006
```

Based on the results from `system.time`, the `rowMeans` approach is over 200 times faster 
than the `apply` loop.

#### 3. `apply` loop versus vectorized approach

In this example row-wise standard deviations are computed with an `apply` loop and then 
in a vectorized manner.

```{r apply_loop_vs_vectorized, eval=FALSE}
system.time(myMAsd <- apply(myMA, 1, sd))
   user  system elapsed
  3.707   0.014   3.721
myMAsd[1:4]
        1         2         3         4
0.8505795 1.3419460 1.3768646 1.3005428

system.time(myMAsd <- sqrt((rowSums((myMA-rowMeans(myMA))^2)) / (length(myMA[1,])-1)))
   user  system elapsed
  0.020   0.009   0.028

myMAsd[1:4]
        1         2         3         4
0.8505795 1.3419460 1.3768646 1.3005428
```

The vector-based approach in the last step is over 200 times faster than the apply loop.

#### 4. Example of fast querying routine applied to a large matrix

##### (a) Create a sample matrix

The following `lfcPvalMA` function creates a test `matrix` containing randomly generated log2 fold changes (LFCs) 
and p-values (here: pval or FDRs) for variable numbers of samples or test results. In biology this dataset mimics the 
results of an analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from several contrasts arranged in a 
single `matrix` (or `data.frame`).

```{r create_stats_ma, eval=TRUE}
lfcPvalMA <- function(Nrow=200, Ncol=4, stats_labels=c("lfc", "pval")) {
    set.seed(1410)
    assign(stats_labels[1], runif(n = Nrow * Ncol, min = -4, max = 4))
    assign(stats_labels[2], runif(n = Nrow * Ncol, min = 0, max = 1))
    lfc_ma <- matrix(lfc, Nrow, Ncol, dimnames=list(paste("g", 1:Nrow, sep=""), paste("t", 1:Ncol, "_", stats_labels[1], sep=""))) 
    pval_ma <- matrix(pval, Nrow, Ncol, dimnames=list(paste("g", 1:Nrow, sep=""), paste("t", 1:Ncol, "_", stats_labels[2], sep=""))) 
    statsMA <- cbind(lfc_ma, pval_ma)
    return(statsMA[, order(colnames(statsMA))])
}
degMA <- lfcPvalMA(Nrow=200, Ncol=4, stats_labels=c("lfc", "pval"))
dim(degMA) 
degMA[1:4,] # Prints first 4 rows of DEG matrix generated as a test data set 
```

##### (b) Organize results in `list`

To filter the results efficiently, it is usually best to store the two different 
stats (here `lfc` and `pval`) in separate matrices (here two) where each has the 
same dimensions and row/column ordering. Note, in this case a `list` 
is used to store the two `matrices`.  

```{r stats_ma_to_list, eval=TRUE}
degList <- list(lfc=degMA[ , grepl("lfc", colnames(degMA))], pval=degMA[ , grepl("pval", colnames(degMA))])
names(degList)
sapply(degList, dim)
```

##### (c) Combinatorial filter

With the above generated data structure of two complementary matrices it is
easy to apply combinatorial filtering routines that are both flexible and
time-efficient (fast).  The following example queries for fold changes of at
least 2 (here `lfc >= 1 | lfc <= -1`) plus p-values of 0.5 or lower. Note, all
intermediate and final results are stored in logical matrices. In addition to
boolean comparisons, one can apply basic mathematical operations, such as
calculating the sum of each cell across many matrices. This returns a numeric matix of
integers representing the counts of `TRUE` values in each position of the
considered logical matrices. Subsequently, one can perform summary and
filtering routines on these count-based matrices which is convenient when
working with large numbers of matrices. All these matrix-to-matrix comparisons
are very fast to compute and require zero looping instructions by the user.

```{r filter_stats, eval=TRUE}
queryResult <- (degList$lfc <= 1 | degList$lfc <= -1) & degList$pval <= 0.5 
colnames(queryResult) <- gsub("_.*", "", colnames(queryResult)) # Adjust column names 
queryResult[1:4,]
```

##### (d) Extract query results

(i) Retrieve row labels (genes) that match the query from the previous step in each column, and 
store them in a `list`.  

```{r id_result_list1, eval=TRUE}
matchingIDlist <- sapply(colnames(queryResult), function(x) names(queryResult[queryResult[ , x] , x]), simplify=FALSE)
matchingIDlist
```

(ii) Return all row labels (genes) that match the above query across a specified number of columns 
(here 2). Note, the `rowSums` function is used for this, which performs the row-wise looping 
internally and extremely fast.

```{r id_result_list2, eval=TRUE}
matchingID <- rowSums(queryResult) > 2 
queryResult[matchingID, , drop=FALSE]
names(matchingID[matchingID])
```

As demonstrated in the above query examples, by setting up the proper data structures (here two 
`matrices` with same dimensions), and utilizing vectorized (matrix-to-matrix) operations 
along with R's built-in `row*` and `col*` stats function family (e.g. `rowSums`) one can 
design with very little code flexible query routines that also run very time-efficient. 

## Functions

### Function Overview

A very useful feature of the R environment is the possibility to expand existing functions and to easily write custom functions. In fact, most of the R software can be viewed as a series of R functions.

__Syntax__ to define function
```{r function_def_syntax, eval=FALSE}
myfct <- function(arg1, arg2, ...) { 
	function_body 
}
```
__Syntax__ to call functions
```{r function_call_syntax, eval=FALSE}
myfct(arg1=..., arg2=...)
```
The value returned by a function is the value of the function body, which is usually an unassigned final expression, _e.g._: `return()`

### Function Syntax Rules
	
__General__

* Functions are defined by 
    1. The assignment with the keyword `function`
    2. The declaration of arguments/variables (`arg1, arg2, ...`) 
    3. The definition of operations (`function_body`) that perform computations on the provided arguments. A function name needs to be assigned to call the function.

__Naming__ 

* Function names can be almost anything. However, the usage of names of existing functions should be avoided.
	
__Arguments__ 

* It is often useful to provide default values for arguments (_e.g._: `arg1=1:10`). This way they don't need to be provided in a function call. The argument list can also be left empty (`myfct <- function() { fct_body }`) if a function is expected to return always the same value(s). The argument `...` can be used to allow one function to pass on argument settings to another.

__Body__

* The actual expressions (commands/operations) are defined in the function body which should be enclosed by braces. The individual commands are separated by semicolons or new lines (preferred).

__Usage__ 

* Functions are called by their name followed by parentheses containing possible argument names. Empty parenthesis after the function name will result in an error message when a function requires certain arguments to be provided by the user. The function name alone will print the definition of a function.

__Scope__

* Variables created inside a function exist only for the life time of a function. Thus, they are not accessible outside of the function. To force variables in functions to exist globally, one can use the double assignment operator: `<<-` 

### Examples

__Define sample function__

```{r define_function_example, eval=TRUE}
myfct <- function(x1, x2=5) { 
	z1 <- x1 / x1
	z2 <- x2 * x2
        myvec <- c(z1, z2) 
        return(myvec)
} 
```

__Function usage__


Apply function to values `2` and `5`
```{r usage_function_example1, eval=TRUE}
myfct(x1=2, x2=5) 
```

Run without argument names
```{r usage_function_example2, eval=TRUE}
myfct(2, 5) 
```

Makes use of default value `5`
```{r usage_function_example3, eval=TRUE}
myfct(x1=2) 
```
Print function definition (often unintended) 
```{r usage_function_example4, eval=TRUE}
myfct 
```

## Useful Utilities

### Debugging Utilities

Several debugging utilities are available for R. They include:

* `traceback`
* `browser`
* `options(error=recover)`
* `options(error=NULL)`
* `debug`

The [Debugging in R page](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/debugging.html) provides an overview of the available resources.

### Regular Expressions

R's regular expression utilities work similar as in other languages. To learn how to use them in R, one can consult the main help page on this topic with `?regexp`.

#### String matching with `grep`

The grep function can be used for finding patterns in strings, here letter `A` in vector `month.name`.
```{r grep_fct, eval=TRUE}
month.name[grep("A", month.name)] 
```

#### String substitution with `gsub`

Example for using regular expressions to substitute a pattern by another one using a back reference. Remember: single escapes `\` need to be double escaped `\\` in R.

```{r gsub_fct, eval=TRUE}
gsub('(i.*a)', 'xxx_\\1', "virginica", perl = TRUE) 
```

### Interpreting a Character String as Expression

Some useful examples

Generates vector of object names in session
```{r ls_fct, eval=TRUE}
myfct <- function(x) x^2
mylist <- ls()
n <- which(mylist %in% "myfct")
mylist[n] 
```

Executes entry in position `n` as expression

```{r eval_expr, eval=TRUE}
get(mylist[n])
get(mylist[n])(2)
```

Alternative approach 
```{r eval_expr2, eval=TRUE}
eval(parse(text=mylist[n])) 
```

### Replacement, Split and Paste Functions for Strings

__Selected examples__

Substitution with back reference which inserts in this example `_` character
```{r back_ref, eval=TRUE}
x <- gsub("(a)","\\1_", month.name[1], perl=T) 
x
```

Split string on inserted character from above
```{r split_string, eval=TRUE}
strsplit(x,"_")
```

Reverse a character string by splitting first all characters into vector fields

```{r reverse_string, eval=TRUE}
paste(rev(unlist(strsplit(x, NULL))), collapse="") 
```

### Time, Date and Sleep

__Selected examples__

Return CPU (and other) times that an expression used (here ls)
```{r sys_time, eval=TRUE}
system.time(ls()) 
```

Return the current system date and time
```{r sys_date, eval=TRUE}
date() 
```

Pause execution of R expressions for a given number of seconds (e.g. in loop)
```{r sys_sleep, eval=TRUE}
Sys.sleep(1) 
```

#### Example

##### Import of Specific File Lines with Regular Expression

The following example demonstrates the retrieval of specific lines from an external file with a regular expression. First, an external file is created with the `cat` function, all lines of this file are imported into a vector with `readLines`, the specific elements (lines) are then retieved with the `grep` function, and the resulting lines are split into vector fields with `strsplit`.

```{r read_lines, eval=TRUE}
cat(month.name, file="zzz.txt", sep="\n")
x <- readLines("zzz.txt")
x[1:6] 
x <- x[c(grep("^J", as.character(x), perl = TRUE))]
t(as.data.frame(strsplit(x, "u")))
```
## Calling External Software

External command-line software can be called with `system`. The following example calls `blastall` from R
```{r system_blast, eval=FALSE}
system("blastall -p blastp -i seq.fasta -d uniprot -o seq.blastp")
```

## Running R Scripts

### Possibilities for Executing R Scripts

#### R console
```{r r_script1, eval=FALSE}
source("my_script.R")
```

#### Command-line

```{sh r_cmd_script1, eval=FALSE}
Rscript my_script.R # or just ./myscript.R after making it executable
R CMD BATCH my_script.R # Alternative way 1 
R --slave < my_script.R # Alternative way 2
```
#### Passing arguments from command-line to R

Create an R script named `test.R` with the following content:

```{sh r_cmd_script2, eval=FALSE}
myarg <- commandArgs()
print(iris[1:myarg[6], ])
```

Then run it from the command-line like this:
```{sh r_cmd_script3, eval=FALSE}
Rscript test.R 10
```

In the given example the number `10` is passed on from the command-line as an argument to the R script which is used to return to `STDOUT` the first 10 rows of the `iris` sample data. If several arguments are provided, they will be interpreted as one string and need to be split in R with the strsplit function. A more detailed example can be found [here](http://manuals.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/home/ht-seq\#TOC-Quality-Reports-of-FASTQ-Files-).


## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

R supports several systems for object-oriented programming (OOP). This includes
an older S3 system, and the more recently introduced R6 and S4 systems. The latter is the
most formal version that supports multiple inheritance, multiple dispatch and
introspection.  Many of these features are not available in the older S3
system. In general, the OOP approach taken by R is to separate the class
specifications from the specifications of generic functions (function-centric
system). The following introduction is restricted to the S4 system since it is
nowadays the preferred OOP method for package development in Bioconductor. More

### Define S4 Classes

#### 1. Define S4 Classes with `setClass()` and `new()`

```{r define_s4, eval=TRUE}
y <- matrix(1:10, 2, 5) # Sample data set
setClass(Class="myclass",
    representation=representation(a="ANY"),
    prototype=prototype(a=y[1:2,]), # Defines default value (optional)
    validity=function(object) { # Can be defined in a separate step using setValidity
        if(class(object@a)[1]!="matrix") {
            return(paste("expected matrix, but obtained", class(object@a)))
        } else {
            return(TRUE)
        }
    }
)
```

The setClass function defines classes. Its most important arguments are

+ `Class`: the name of the class
+ `representation`: the slots that the new class should have and/or other classes that this class extends.
+ `prototype`: an object providing default data for the slots.
+ `contains`: the classes that this class extends.
+ `validity`, `access`, `version`: control arguments included for compatibility with S-Plus.
+ `where`: the environment to use to store or remove the definition as meta data.

#### 2. Create new class instance

The function `new` creates an instance of a class (here `myclass`).

```{r new_s4, eval=TRUE}
myobj <- new("myclass", a=y)
myobj
```

If evaluated the following would return an error due to wrong input type (`data.frame` instead of `matrix`).

```{r new_s4_error, eval=FALSE}
new("myclass", a=iris) # Returns error due to wrong input  
```

The arguments of `new` are:

+ `Class`: the name of the class
+ `...`: data to include in the new object with arguments according to slots in class definition

#### 3. Initialization method

A more generic way of creating class instances is to define an initialization
method (more details below).

```{r s4_init_method, eval=TRUE}
setMethod("initialize", "myclass", function(.Object, a) {
    .Object@a <- a/a
    .Object
})
new("myclass", a = y)
```

#### 4. Usage and helper functions

The '@' operator extracts the contents of a slot. Its usage should be limited to internal 
functions.

```{r s4_helper_fct1, eval=TRUE}
myobj@a 
```

Create a new S4 object from an old one.

```{r s4_helper_fct2, eval=TRUE}
initialize(.Object=myobj, a=as.matrix(cars[1:2,])) 
```

If evaluated the `removeClass` function removes an object from the current session.
This does not apply to associated methods.

```{r s4_helper_fct3, eval=FALSE}
removeClass("myclass") 
```

#### 5. Inheritance

Inheritance allows to define new classes that inherit all properties (e.g. data slots, methods) 
from their existing parent classes. The `contains` argument used below allows to extend 
existing classes. This propagates all slots of parent classes.

```{r s4_inheritance1, eval=TRUE}
setClass("myclass1", representation(a = "character", b = "character"))
setClass("myclass2", representation(c = "numeric", d = "numeric"))
setClass("myclass3", contains=c("myclass1", "myclass2"))
new("myclass3", a=letters[1:4], b=letters[1:4], c=1:4, d=4:1)
getClass("myclass1")
getClass("myclass2")
getClass("myclass3")
```

#### 6. Coerce objects to another class

The following defines a coerce method. After this the standard `as(..., "...")`
syntax can be used to coerce the new class to another one.

```{r s4_coerce, eval=TRUE}
setAs(from="myclass", to="character", def=function(from) as.character(as.matrix(from@a)))
as(myobj, "character")
```

#### 7. Virtual classes

Virtual classes are constructs for which no instances will be or can be
created. They are used to link together classes which may have distinct
representations (e.g. cannot inherit from each other) but for which one wants
to provide similar functionality. Often it is desired to create a virtual class
and to then have several other classes extend it. Virtual classes can be
defined by leaving out the representation argument or including the class
`VIRTUAL` as illustrated here:

```{r s4_virtual, eval=TRUE}
setClass("myVclass")
setClass("myVclass", representation(a = "character", "VIRTUAL"))
```

#### 8. Introspection of classes

Useful functions to introspect classes include:

+ `getClass("myclass")`
+ `getSlots("myclass")`
+ `slotNames("myclass")`
+ `extends("myclass2")`

### Assign Generics and Methods

Generics and methods can be assigned with the methods `setGeneric()` and `setMethod()`.

#### 1. Accessor functions 

This avoids the usage of the `@` operator.

```{r s4_setgeneric, eval=TRUE}
setGeneric(name="acc", def=function(x) standardGeneric("acc"))
setMethod(f="acc", signature="myclass", definition=function(x) {
	return(x@a)
})
acc(myobj)
```

#### 2. Replacement methods 

a. Using custom accessor function with `acc <-` syntax.

```{r s4_replace_acc, eval=TRUE}
setGeneric(name="acc<-", def=function(x, value) standardGeneric("acc<-"))
setReplaceMethod(f="acc", signature="myclass", definition=function(x, value) {
				 x@a <- value
                 return(x)
})
## After this the following replace operations with 'acc' work on new object class
acc(myobj)[1,1] <- 999 # Replaces first value
colnames(acc(myobj)) <- letters[1:5] # Assigns new column names
rownames(acc(myobj)) <- letters[1:2] # Assigns new row names
myobj
```

b. Replacement method using `[` operator, here `[...] <-` syntax.

```{r s4_replace_bracket, eval=TRUE}
setReplaceMethod(f="[", signature="myclass", definition=function(x, i, j, value) {
				 x@a[i,j] <- value
                 return(x)
})
myobj[1,2] <- 999
myobj
```

#### 3. Behavior of bracket operator

The behavior of the bracket `[` subsetting operator can be defined as follows.


```{r s4_bracket_subsetting, eval=TRUE}
setMethod(f="[", signature="myclass",
		  definition=function(x, i, j, ..., drop) {
          x@a <- x@a[i,j]
          return(x)
})
myobj[1:2, 1:3] # Standard subsetting works now on new class
```

#### 4. Print behavior

A convient summary printing behavior for a new class should always be defined.

```{r s4_printing, eval=TRUE}
setMethod(f="show", signature="myclass", definition=function(object) {
		  cat("An instance of ", "\"", class(object), "\"", " with ", length(acc(object)[,1]), " elements", "\n", sep="")
		  if(length(acc(object)[,1])>=5) {
				print(as.data.frame(rbind(acc(object)[1:2,], ...=rep("...", length(acc(object)[1,])), acc(object)[(length(acc(object)[,1])-1):length(acc(object)[,1]),])))
		  } else {
				print(acc(object))
		  }
})
myobj # Prints object with custom method
```

#### 5. Define custom methods

The following gives an example for defining a data specific method, here randomizing row 
order of matrix stored in new S4 class.

```{r s4_custom_methods, eval=TRUE}
setGeneric(name="randomize", def=function(x) standardGeneric("randomize"))
setMethod(f="randomize", signature="myclass", definition=function(x) {
		  acc(x)[sample(1:length(acc(x)[,1]), length(acc(x)[,1])), ]
})
randomize(myobj)
```

#### 6. Plotting method

Define a graphical plotting method for new class and allow users to access it with 
R's generic `plot` function.

```{r s4_plot_methods, eval=TRUE}
setMethod(f="plot", signature="myclass", definition=function(x, ...) {
		  barplot(as.matrix(acc(x)), ...)
})
plot(myobj)
```

#### 7. Utilities to inspect methods

Important inspection methods for classes include:

+ `showMethods(class="myclass")`
+ `findMethods("randomize")`
+ `getMethod("randomize", signature="myclass")`
+ `existsMethod("randomize", signature="myclass")`


## Building R Packages

This section has been moved to a dedicated tutorial on R package development [here](https://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/GEN242/tutorials/rpackages/rpackages/).

## Programming Exercises

### Exercise 1

#### `for` loop

__Task 1.1__: Compute the mean of each row in `myMA` by applying the mean function in a `for` loop.

```{r exercise1_for, eval=TRUE}
myMA <- matrix(rnorm(500), 100, 5, dimnames=list(1:100, paste("C", 1:5, sep="")))
myve_for <- NULL
for(i in seq(along=myMA[,1])) {
	myve_for <- c(myve_for, mean(as.numeric(myMA[i, ])))
}
myResult <- cbind(myMA, mean_for=myve_for)
myResult[1:4, ]
```

#### `while` loop

__Task 1.2__: Compute the mean of each row in `myMA` by applying the mean function in a `while` loop.

```{r exercise1_while, eval=TRUE}
z <- 1
myve_while <- NULL
while(z <= length(myMA[,1])) {
	myve_while <- c(myve_while, mean(as.numeric(myMA[z, ])))
	z <- z + 1
}
myResult <- cbind(myMA, mean_for=myve_for, mean_while=myve_while)
myResult[1:4, -c(1,2)]
```
__Task 1.3__: Confirm that the results from both mean calculations are identical
```{r exercise1_confirm, eval=TRUE}
all(myResult[,6] == myResult[,7])
```

#### `apply` loop
	
__Task 1.4__: Compute the mean of each row in myMA by applying the mean function in an `apply` loop
```{r exercise1_apply, eval=TRUE}
myve_apply <- apply(myMA, 1, mean)
myResult <- cbind(myMA, mean_for=myve_for, mean_while=myve_while, mean_apply=myve_apply)
myResult[1:4, -c(1,2)]
```

#### Avoiding loops

__Task 1.5__: When operating on large data sets it is much faster to use the `rowMeans` function

```{r exercise1_noloops, eval=TRUE}
mymean <- rowMeans(myMA)
myResult <- cbind(myMA, mean_for=myve_for, mean_while=myve_while, mean_apply=myve_apply, mean_int=mymean)
myResult[1:4, -c(1,2,3)]
```
To find out which other built-in functions for basic calculations exist, type `?rowMeans`.

### Exercise 2 

#### Custom functions

__Task 2.1__: Use the following code as basis to implement a function that allows the user to compute the mean for any combination of columns in a matrix or data frame. The first argument of this function should specify the input data set, the second the mathematical function to be passed on (_e.g._ `mean`, `sd`, `max`) and the third one should allow the selection of the columns by providing a grouping vector.

```{r exercise2_fct, eval=TRUE}
myMA <- matrix(rnorm(100000), 10000, 10, dimnames=list(1:10000, paste("C", 1:10, sep="")))
myMA[1:2,]
myList <- tapply(colnames(myMA), c(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4), list) 
names(myList) <- sapply(myList, paste, collapse="_")
myMAmean <- sapply(myList, function(x) apply(myMA[,x], 1, mean))
myMAmean[1:4,] 
```
<!---
Solution
```{r exercise2_fct_solution, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, keep.source=TRUE}
myMAcomp <- function(myMA=myMA, group=c(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4), myfct=mean) {
	myList <- tapply(colnames(myMA), group, list)
	names(myList) <- sapply(myList, paste, collapse="_")
	myMAmean <- sapply(myList, function(x) apply(myMA[, x, drop=FALSE], 1, myfct))
	return(myMAmean)
}
myMAcomp(myMA=myMA, group=c(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4), myfct=mean)[1:2,] 
```
-->


### Exercise 3

#### Nested loops to generate similarity matrices

__Task 3.1__: Create a sample list populated with character vectors of different lengths

```{r nested_loops1, eval=TRUE}
setlist <- lapply(11:30, function(x) sample(letters, x, replace=TRUE))
names(setlist) <- paste("S", seq(along=setlist), sep="") 
setlist[1:6]
```

__Task 3.2__: Compute the length for all pairwise intersects of the vectors stored in `setlist`. The intersects can be determined with the `%in%` function like this: `sum(setlist[[1]] %in% setlist[[2]])`

```{r nested_loops2, eval=TRUE}
setlist <- sapply(setlist, unique)
olMA <- sapply(names(setlist), function(x) sapply(names(setlist), 
               function(y) sum(setlist[[x]] %in% setlist[[y]])))
olMA[1:12,] 
```
__Task 3.3__ Plot the resulting intersect matrix as heat map. 
The `image` or the `pheatmap` functions can be used for this.
```{r nested_loops3, eval=TRUE}
library(pheatmap); library("RColorBrewer")
pheatmap(olMA, color=brewer.pal(9,"Blues"), cluster_rows=FALSE, cluster_cols=FALSE, display_numbers=TRUE, number_format="%.0f", fontsize_number=10)
# image(olMA) 
```

### Exercise 4

#### Build your own R package

__Task 4.1__: Save one or more of your functions to a file called `script.R` and build the package with the `package.skeleton` function.

```{r package_skeleton2, eval=FALSE}
package.skeleton(name="mypackage", code_files=c("script1.R"))
```

__Task 4.2__: Build tarball of the package

```{r build_package_tar, eval=FALSE}
system("R CMD build mypackage")
```

__Task 4.3__: Install and use package

```{r install_package_tar, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("mypackage_1.0.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")
library(mypackage)
?myMAcomp # Opens help for function defined by mypackage
```
