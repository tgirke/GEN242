## Overview

Each student has been assigned one journal publication to present in class. The
expected structure of the paper presentations is outlined in this [Slideshow Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14Jdss8C5YvwkBsTxL-Z4HLE5W8RkfxprOpK-_-dzSCY/edit?usp=sharing). 
A detailed presentation schedule is available on the internal [Course Schedule](https://elearn.ucr.edu/courses/134360). 
The grading of both the paper and project presentations (2-3) includes
anonymous feedback from all students as well as the instructor, where
understanding of the material, clarity of the oral presentations and critical
thinking are the main grading criteria. The grading form is [here](). 
The following lists the assigned papers organized by course project topics.
