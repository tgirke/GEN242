## Shared big data space on HPCC

All larger data sets of the coure projects will be organized in a big data space under
`/bigdata/gen242/<user_name>`. Within this space, each student will read and write data to a 
subdirectory named after their project:

+ `/bigdata/gen242/<user_name>/projdata`

Within each `projdata` directory all input files of a workflow (_e.g._ FASTQ) will be saved to 
a `data` directory and all output files will be written to a `results` directory. To set up the proper
directory structure, `cd` into `/bigdata/gen242/<user_name>`, create the directory named `projdata` 
and then within this directory create the `data` and `results` subdirectories. The full path to these 
directories should look like this:

+ `/bigdata/gen242/<user_name>/projdata/data`
+ `/bigdata/gen242/<user_name>/projdata/results`

## GitHub repositories for projects

Students will work on their course projects within GitHub repositories, one for each student.
These project repositories are private and have been shared with each student via GitHub Classroom.
To populate a course project with an initial project workflow, please follow the instructions
given.

## Generate workflow environment with project data

1. Log in to the HPCC cluster and set your working directory to `bigdata` or (`/bigdata/gen242/<user_name>`)
2. Clone the GitHub repository for your project with `git clone ...` (URLs listed [here](https://bit.ly/3n07XFB)) and then `cd` into this directory.
2. Generate the workflow environment for your project on the HPCC cluster with `genWorkenvir` from `systemPipeRdata`. 
3. Delete the default `data` and `results` directories and replace them with symbolic links pointing to the above described `data` and `results` directories 
of your course project. For instance, the project RNA-Seq should create the symbolic links for their `data` and `results` directories like this:
   ```sh 
   ln -s /bigdata/gen242/<user_name>/projdata/data data
   ln -s /bigdata/gen242/<user_name>/projdata/results results
   ```
4. Add the workflow directory to the GitHub repository of your project with `git add -A` and the run `commit` and `push` as outlined in the GitHub instructions of this course [here](https://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/GEN242/tutorials/github/github/#github-basics-from-command-line). 
5. Download the FASTQ files of your project with `getSRAfastq` (see below) to the `data` directory of your project, here '/bigdata/gen242/<user_name>/projdata/data'. 
6. Generate a proper `targets` file for your project where the first column(s) point(s) to the downloaded FASTQ files. In addition, provide sample names matching the experimental design (columns: `SampleNames` and `Factor`). More details about the structure of targets files are provided [here](https://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/GEN242/tutorials/systempiper/systempiper/#structure-of-targets-file). Ready to use targets files for both the RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq project can be downloaded as tab separated (TSV) files from [here](https://github.com/tgirke/GEN242/tree/main/content/en/assignments/Projects/targets_files). Alternatively, one can download the corresponding Google Sheets with the `read_sheet` function from the `googlesheets4` package ([RNA-Seq GSheet](https://bit.ly/2QH19Ry) and [ChIP-Seq GSheet](https://bit.ly/2QFjTAV)). 
7. Inspect and adjust the `.param` files you will be using. For instance, make sure the software modules you are loading and the path to the reference genome are correct. 
8. Every time you start working on your project you `cd` into the directory of the repository and then run `git pull` to get the latest change. When you are done, you commit and push your changes back to GitHub with `git commit -am "some edits"; git push -u origin main`.

## Download of project data

Open R from within the GitHub respository of your project and then run the following code section, but only those that apply to your project.

### FASTQ files from SRA

#### Choose FASTQ data for your project

+ The FASTQ files for the ChIP-Seq project are from SRA study [SRP002174](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP002174) ([Kaufman et al. 2010](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20360106))
```r
sraidv <- paste("SRR0388", 45:51, sep="") 
```

+ The FASTQ files for the RNA-Seq project are from SRA study [SRP010938](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP010938) ([Howard et al. 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24098335))
```r
sraidv <- paste("SRR4460", 27:44, sep="")
```

#### Load libraries and modules

```r
library(systemPipeR)
moduleload("sratoolkit/2.9.2")
system('fastq-dump --help') # prints help to screen
```

#### Redirect cache output of SRA Toolkit 

Newer versions of the SRA Toolkit create a cache directory (named `ncbi`) in the highest level of a user's home directory. 
To save space in home accounts (limited to 20GB), users need to redirect this output to their project's
`data` directory via a symbolic link. The following shows how to do this for the `data` directory
of the `ChIP-Seq` project.

```r
system("ln -s /bigdata/gen242/<user_name>/projdata/data ~/ncbi")
```

#### Define download function
The following function downloads and extracts the FASTQ files for each project from SRA.
Internally, it uses the `fastq-dump` utility of the SRA Toolkit from NCBI.

```r
getSRAfastq <- function(sraid, targetdir, maxreads="1000000000") {
    system(paste("fastq-dump --split-files --gzip --maxSpotId", 
                  maxreads, sraid, "--outdir", targetdir))
}
```

#### Run download

Note the following performs the download in serialized mode for the chosen data set and saves the extracted FASTQ files to 
the path specified under `targetdir`.
```r
mydir <- getwd(); setwd("data")
for(i in sraidv) getSRAfastq(sraid=i, targetdir=".")
setwd(mydir)
```

Alternatively, the download can be performed in parallelized mode with `BiocParallel`. Please run this version only on one of the compute nodes.
```r
mydir <- getwd(); setwd("data")
# bplapply(sraidv, getSRAfastq, targetdir=".", BPPARAM = MulticoreParam(workers=4))
setwd(mydir)
```

### Download reference genome and annotation

The following `downloadRefs` function downloads the _Arabidopsis thaliana_ genome sequence and GFF file from the [TAIR FTP site](ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Genes/TAIR10_genome_release/). 
It also assigns consistent chromosome identifiers to make them the same among both the genome sequence and the GFF file. This is
important for many analysis routines such as the read counting in the RNA-Seq workflow.  

```r
downloadRefs <- function(rerun=FALSE) {
    if(rerun==TRUE) {
        library(Biostrings)
        download.file("https://www.arabidopsis.org/download_files/Genes/TAIR10_genome_release/TAIR10_chromosome_files/TAIR10_chr_all.fas", "./data/tair10.fasta")
	dna <- readDNAStringSet("./data/tair10.fasta")
        names(dna) <- paste(rep("Chr", 7), c(1:5, "M", "C"), sep="") # Fixes chromomse ids
        writeXStringSet(dna, "./data/tair10.fasta")
        download.file("https://www.arabidopsis.org/download_files/Genes/TAIR10_genome_release/TAIR10_gff3/TAIR10_GFF3_genes.gff", "./data/tair10.gff")
        download.file("https://www.arabidopsis.org/download_files/Genes/TAIR10_genome_release/TAIR10_functional_descriptions", "./data/tair10_functional_descriptions")
        }
}
```

After importing/sourcing the above function, execute it as follows:
```r
downloadRefs(rerun=TRUE) 
```
