## RNA-Seq Workflow  

1. Read quality assessment, filtering and trimming 
2. Map reads against reference genome 
3. Perform read counting for required ranges (_e.g._ exonic gene ranges)
4. Normalization of read counts
5. Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
6. Clustering of gene expression profiles 
7. Gene set enrichment analysis

## Challenge Projects

### 1. Cluster and network analysis methods

+ Run workflow from start to finish (steps 1-7) on RNA-Seq data set from Howard et al. (2013)
+ Challenge project tasks
    + Compare at least 2-3 cluster analysis methods (e.g. hierarchical, k-means, Fuzzy C-Means, WGCNA, other) and assess the performance differences as follows:
        + Analyze the similarities and differences in the cluster groupings obtained from the two methods. 
        + Do the differences affect the results of the downstream functional enrichment analysis?
        + Plot the performance of the clustering methods in form of ROC curves and/or record their AUC values. Functional annotations (e.g. GO, KEGG, Pfam) could be used as a benchmark for defining true results.

### 2. Cluster and network analysis methods

+ Similar as above but with different combination of clustering methods and/or performance testing approach.
