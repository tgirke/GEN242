## RNA-Seq Workflow  

1. Read quality assessment, filtering and trimming 
2. Map reads against reference genome 
3. Perform read counting for required ranges (_e.g._ exonic gene ranges)
4. Normalization of read counts
5. Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
6. Clustering of gene expression profiles 
7. Gene set enrichment analysis

## Challenge Projects

### 1. Comparison of DEG analysis methods

+ Run workflow from start to finish (steps 1-7) on RNA-Seq data set from Howard et al. (2013)
+ Challenge project tasks
    + Compare the DEG analysis method chosen for paper presentation with at least 1-2 additional methods (_e.g._ one student compares _edgeR_ _vs._ _baySeq_, and other student _DESeq2_ _vs._ _limma/voom_). Assess the results as follows:
        + Analyze the similarities and differences in the DEG lists obtained from the two methods using intersect matrices, venn diagrams and/or upset plots.
        + Assess the impact of the DEG method on the downstream gene set enrichment analysis?
        + Plot the performance of the DEG methods in form of ROC curves and/or record their AUC values. A consensus DEG set or the one from the Howard et al. (2013) paper could be used as a ‘pseudo’ ground truth result.

### 2. Comparison of DEG analysis methods

+ Similar as above but with different combination of DEG methods and/or performance testing approach.
