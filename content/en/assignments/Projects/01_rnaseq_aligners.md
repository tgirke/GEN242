## RNA-Seq Workflow  

1. Read quality assessment, filtering and trimming 
2. Map reads against reference genome 
3. Perform read counting for required ranges (_e.g._ exonic gene ranges)
4. Normalization of read counts
5. Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
6. Clustering of gene expression profiles 
7. Gene set enrichment analysis

## Challenge Project: Comparison of RNA-Seq Aligners 

+ Run workflow from start to finish (steps 1-7) on RNA-Seq data set from Howard et al. (2013)
+ Challenge project tasks
    + Compare the RNA-Seq aligner HISAT2 with at least 1-2 other aligners, such as  Rsubread, Star or Kallisto. Evaluate the impact of the aligner on the downstream analysis results including:
        + Read counts
        + Differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
        + Generate plots to compare the results efficiently
